                                Under social inclusion, Ultimate Step Support uses Activity-Based Care
                                healthcare delivery model that emphasises on preventive care, client
                                engagement and health promotion. It is based on the premise that by keeping
                                people active and engaged in activities, they will be more likely to stay healthy
                                and avoid costly medical interventions. There is a growing body of evidence
                                that Activity-Based Care (ABC) can have a positive impact on the health and
                                well-being of adults. ABC is an approach to care that emphasize, promote and
                                support physical activity and social engagement. We work to engage
                                individuals we support in their own health and wellness through education,
                                counselling, and community support.<br/><br/>

                The benefits of gardening are well documented and we offer a full range of horticultural experiences to service users. Whether its 
                potting and planting, harvesting our allotment or maintaining our wildlife-friendly wildflower garden service users can experience 
                the therapeutic benefits of being close to nature. Spending time outdoors and tending to plants is known to reduce stress and promote 
                a sense of accomplishment and higher self-esteem, as well as boosting psychological well-being.
